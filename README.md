# GPPSO
This repository contains the code of the paper: Generation-based Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization for Adversarial Text Attacks
## Usage  
The GPPSO can be easily tested by the command line in the TextAttack framework:  
`textattack attack --recipe gppso --model bert-base-uncased-mr --num-examples 1000`  
This will attack BERT model on MR dataset using the GPPSO.  
## Acknowledgement  
This code is based on the [TextAttack](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) framework.
